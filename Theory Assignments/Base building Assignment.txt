Assignment

   1) What is the Internet? Explain in your own words
Answer:The Internet is like a giant web connecting computers all over the world. It lets people
share information, like pictures, videos, and messages. You can explore websites, play games,
and talk to friends online. It's like a big library where you can find answers to almost any
question. To use the Internet, you need a device like a computer or phone and a connection,
usually through Wi-Fi or cables.

   2) What is a web browser? Explain in your own words
Answer: A web browser is like a digital window to the Internet. It's a program on your computer
or phone that lets you visit websites. You type a web address, and the browser fetches and
displays the site. You can click on links, watch videos, and interact with different web pages.
Popular browsers include Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Browsers help us navigate and explore
the vast content available on the Internet.

   3) What is a browser engine? Explain in your own words.
Answer: A browser engine is like the brain inside a web browser. It interprets the code of
websites and turns it into what we see on our screens. It's responsible for rendering text, images,
and interactive elements. Different browsers may use different engines, like Blink in Chrome or
Gecko in Firefox. The engine plays a crucial role in how fast and smoothly a browser can display
web content. It's essentially the behind-the-scenes technology that brings websites to life on our
devices.

   4) What is a static site? Explain in your own words.
Answer: A static site is like a digital brochure that stays the same for every visitor. Its content is
fixed and doesn't change often. Unlike dynamic sites, it doesn't pull information from a database
or allow user interactions. Static sites are simple and fast but may lack features like personalized
content or real-time updates. They're well-suited for straightforward information presentation,
like company portfolios or personal blogs with relatively stable content.

   5) What is a dynamic site? Explain in your own words.
Answer: A dynamic site is like a constantly changing digital space. It can display personalized
content based on user interactions or data from a database. Unlike static sites, dynamic sites are
more interactive and can update in real-time. They often include features like user accounts,
comments, and dynamic forms. Examples include social media platforms, e-commerce websites,
and news portals, where content adapts based on user preferences and actions.
